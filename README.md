# portfolio-php

After many atempts to make the ultimate portfolio application using every possible stack,
including the most bloated ones, I went back to simple things using a php monolith.

I found this is the best choice considering my maintenance abilities and the traffic volume I expect.

## Configuration

The following environement variables should be set in order for the application to properly work:

    DB_DSN=
    UPLOAD_PATH=
    FILE_ROOT=
    GEOCODE_API_KEY=
    CHECKWX_API_KEY=
